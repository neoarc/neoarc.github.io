	- Record a video or gif of the bug
	- Go to #bug

The developer has his own reactions for bug submissions. Do NOT use these:
- <img src="https://discord.com/assets/0cfc29f75efcc78c7c38580fffe314ba.svg" width="16"> = It is a bug.                        
- <img src="https://discord.com/assets/8becd37ab9d13cdfe37c08c496a9def3.svg" width="16"> = It is not a bug.                    
- <img src="https://discord.com/assets/212e30e47232be03033a87dc58edaa95.svg" width="16"> = The bug was already fixed.          
- <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/452493235114213390.png?v=1" width="16"> = The bug is half-way at being fixed.
- <img src="https://discord.com/assets/3e531d8e171629e9433db0bb431b2e12.svg" width="16"> = Can't understand this report.      
 
A moderator may also be able to react with one of these if the bug report is faulty or plain bad.

### My game crashed. What should I do?
1. Game(or editor) will display a dialog to select a full dump or mini dump.
2. Whichever you chose, it will create a dump file in the game folder.
3. Go to your game folder and upload the dump to a site (Mediafire, Google Drive or Mega for example)
4. In #bug, follow the [bug report template](#bug-reporting-form), describing everything you did before crash
5. Post the link of dump file there.

### Things you should have in mind
- Full dump is much better than small dump
	- it's more detailed and contains more information. Whenever possible, choose full dump.
- If you're a new member and you don't follow the Bug/Request format you'll get a higher warning.
- Once: Warning
- Twice: Kick

## Request & Idea
- You can request anything with peace of mind, but you must follow [template](#request-form).
- Please try to avoid requesting things that were already requested.
- You can request already requested things, but do not spam it.

The developer (neoarc) has his own reactions for requests. Do NOT use these (Mods can also reject a request if this doesn't follow the format / is plain badly):
- <img src="https://discord.com/assets/0cfc29f75efcc78c7c38580fffe314ba.svg" width="16"> = The request was accepted.
- <img src="https://discord.com/assets/8becd37ab9d13cdfe37c08c496a9def3.svg" width="16"> = The request was denied.
- <img src="https://discord.com/assets/039d43e53c13e4adfc1ea88b7b563b9d.svg" width="16"> = It's already in the roadmap, do NOT request.
- <img src="https://discord.com/assets/3e531d8e171629e9433db0bb431b2e12.svg" width="16"> = Can't understand the request, make it clearer.
- <img src="https://discord.com/assets/263a7f4eeb6f69e46d969fa479188592.svg" width="16"> = Request under development
- <img src="https://discord.com/assets/212e30e47232be03033a87dc58edaa95.svg" width="16"> = The request is complete.

A moderator can deny your request if it's plain bad.

## Contribute

Here is how you contribute to this game and the community. 
- You're allowed to help us by submitting your sprites and music into #resource-sprites and #resource-sounds, of course they must be suitable to said theme.
- Keep in mind that you must follow the resource submission template in order to submit.
- You're also going to help a lot if you report bugs in #bug. 
	- It's quicker to find out about bugs if they're reported.
- You can help newbies by telling them on what to do, such as reading the rules.

## Voice Chat
- Don't make unnecessary noise
	- Include blowing on your mic, screaming, or having music in the background playing.
- If your surroundings are way too loud, try using Push to Talk
	- It can be set up in the Discord's User Settings, in the Voice & Video section.
- If you don't have a microphone, all the topics that are related to the voice chat goes to #voice-chat and #voice-off-topic.
- Stay on topic with the current channel
	- If you're in mario-multiverse-topic, talk about Mario Multiverse
- Speak the correct languages on each channel
	- All the channels in the Voice section are english
	- You can speak other languages in the International Voice section.
- Do NOT stream any NSFW content in the voice channels, such as gore or pornography.
- All of the server's rules still apply here!

## Templates
- When reporting a bug, writing a request, or contributing (as sending a sprite file or a sound) you need to follow a template.
- Why? Because they make the server organized and clean, and help the developer to find what it is about easily.

### Bug reporting form
1. The bug explanation/what is happening
- In order to report the bug, we need to know what the bug is about, or what it is.
2. A screenshot or a gif of the bug, or what it looks like. You can record a GIF easily with a free tool known as [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/)
- Any screenshots or footage of the bug being reproduced will really help.
3. How to reproduce the bug, or its reproduction steps. Try it several times to make sure it works.
- We need it in order to perform the bug and find the solution to it.
4. The map file, where you're able to perform the bug. *optional*
- It's much easier than having to recreate the bug. But then again, it's optional.
5. What should be happening and what shouldn't be happening.
- Of course you need to know what must be happening instead of what shouldn't be.
6. Describe bug happens everytime/or sometimes
7. What version of game do you have

### Request form
1. The element you want to be added into the game
- Self explanatory, the name of the element you want to be added in the game. 
2. An explanation about the element
- You will explain how the element works in the games, and how it looks like. (might contain footage/image)
3. Its origin
- Where the element debuted or appeared in the series. If non-existent, you can put it as "none" though.
4. The reason you want it to be in SFMB
- Why do you think it should be in the game? Must be convincing.
5. How it will work in SFMB
- How it works in-game or in the editor. Such as if it has an option, or if it IS an option, etc.

### Resource form
Contributions to resources (sprites, sounds) for this game must use the ResourceCommitter program. 
- You can find it in #resource-sprite channel's pinned post.
- When uploading resources through ResourceCommitter, all messages are automatically created, so there is no form.

# EOF
Congraturations! You read all rules.
