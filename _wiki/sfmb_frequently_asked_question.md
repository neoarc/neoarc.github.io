#### Q. Why won’t SFMB start up after a computer reboot?

- Make sure Discord app is open.
- Since the game uses it to verify your account on startup.

#### Q. Can you download SFMB on multiple computers?
(For example your pc and your laptop?)

- Yes, there is no limit.

#### Q: Can you play SFMB on Linux System?

- Basically, no.
- But I think you can run with WINE.

#### Q: What do I do if I delete a SFMB file by accident?

1. [Click this](sfmb://forceupdate), this will let you download missing file.
1. If you deleted core file such as `Mario.exe`, then force-update won't work.

- Run `MarioConfig.exe`

#### Q. Why is the game still in closed beta?

- Complex issue (WIP)

#### Q. Why do I need to have Discord open to log in?

- Because game uses Discord Rich Presence to check your Discord ID.

#### Q. How do I become Bug Finder?

- Report 5+ bugs
- And ask to admin (neoarc)

#### Q. Why doesn't my collected coins match my coin counter?

- You don't earn game currency (coins you can buy stuff with) from collecting ingame coins.
